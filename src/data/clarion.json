    "one": "During my time at Madison College, I participated in the college newspaper where I managed to land my first managerial role as design director. The next year, I interviewed and was chosen by a panel to be The Clarion's editor-in-chief. Before the year started, I took it upon myself–with the help of the student advisor and managing editor–to redesign the entire publication from head-to-toe.",
    "two": "Below are some of the page designs, illustrations and written articles that I contributed to. In most cases, I did the page designs and illustrations by myself (16 pages, twice monthly) and the editorial staff wrote the content (woohoo, delegation!). In total, there were ~100 people that contributed over the course of the 2012-2013 school year!"
